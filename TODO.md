# TODO

- [x] Build the editor shell with a header, sidebar, and main editor area using Dioxus components.
- [x] Manage document text with a `use_signal` hook that stores a `String` and updates via `oninput`.
- [x] Render a bound `<textarea>` as the editing surface with live content preview.
- [x] Show live document stats such as character and line counts derived from the signal.
- [x] Add basic layout and typography using Dioxus `style!`/`global_styles!` helpers instead of ad-hoc inline strings.
